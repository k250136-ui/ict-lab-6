    <h1>Inception</h1>
    <p><strong>Actor:</strong> <i>Leonardo DiCaprio </i></p>
    <p>"Inception is a mind-bending science fiction thriller directed by Christopher Nolan. 
        The story revolves around Dom Cobb, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, 
        who is a skilled thief with the rare ability to enter people’s dreams and steal valuable secrets from their subconscious. 
        However, instead of stealing an idea, Cobb is given the challenge of performing “inception,” which means planting an idea deep inside a person’s mind without them realizing it. 
        The movie takes the audience on a thrilling journey through multiple layers of dreams, each with its own rules and dangers. 
        With its intense action scenes, emotional depth, and complex narrative, Inception keeps viewers questioning what is real and what is just a dream.
